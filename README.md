# BMICalculator
A simple Java program that calculates BMI (Body Mass Index) based on user input for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
This program prompts the user to enter their weight and height, calculates the BMI, and then interprets the BMI value to classify it into different weight categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).
